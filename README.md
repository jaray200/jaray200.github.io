# Bingo Board Maker
This code generates a 5x5 bingo board filled with text from options.js. 

#### Some Cool Stuff
- Printer-friendly: I use @media css settings to control what is printed. The board is printed without breaking the page, along with attribution text under it. The title image and the redo/print buttons below are hidden when printed. 
- It loads the options from a JavaScript array. You can fill this array, found in options.js, with any text you want, including paragraphs.
